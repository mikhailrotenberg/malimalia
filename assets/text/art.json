Its resilience and dignity hint at the possibility of transformation, that even in the face of radical change and the weakening of the traditional influence of patriarchy, it can find a new way to exist. This symbolizes both the resistance of old structures and their ability to change and adapt in the face of the modern world."

Its color and appearance speak of contradictions, hidden truths and violation of traditional norms. Its appearance can evoke feelings of anxiety and dissent, symbolizing change that challenges the existing order."

In the past, selfless acts were perceived as an act of selflessness, where the personal interests of the sacrificer were placed below the interests of society or another person. However, in modern times, where personal data and social media play a significant role, the concept of self-sacrifice has become more manageable and controllable."
