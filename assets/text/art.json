Its resilience and dignity hint at the possibility of transformation, that even in the face of radical change and the weakening of the traditional influence of patriarchy, it can find a new way to exist. This symbolizes both the resistance of old structures and their ability to change and adapt in the face of the modern world."

The red-orange background, resembling a raging fire, represents the intensity of both internal and external conflicts. This fire embodies passions, fears, and the struggle against imposed ideas. The magpies, closely tied to collective consciousness, seem to whisper their stories, imposing foreign rules on the individual and limiting their freedom."
